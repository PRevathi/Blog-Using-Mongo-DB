Want to Contribute ?

I'm so happy if you do. Fork the project, make whatever changes you want to do and submit a pull request. 

For testing it locally, there's a `BlogController.java` file included in the `src` folder. 
Open up the java terminal and run the BlogController.java file ( You need to have **Mongo DB** installed  before start running java code ).
